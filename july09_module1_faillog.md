# Fail Log: Module 1
## 09 July 2017
---
### what I was trying to do
- I completed [exercises 1-4 of module 1](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Exercises/) in the Crafting Digital History Workbook

### what I did
- I followed the instructions on http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Exercises/ in order to learn about markdown, DHBox, the command line, git, and GitHub.
- I learned basic markdown syntax
- I installed and created files using the command line
- I learned how to use git to create version control in my projects
- I learned how to push, pull, and clone git projects to and from GitHub
- I recorded some of my work in todayscommands.txt and commands_module1_exercise1.txt

### challenges
- when trying to merge my branch "experiment" to the master of "first-repo", I experienced a conflict. Using Google, I was able to figure out how to resolve the conflict by editing the file containing the conflict (recently_read.md) in nano. I described my resolution in my commit message. The merge succeeded.
- I lost my internet connection halfway through exercise 4. I do not know how to recover the command history from before the connection was lost.
- when trying to merge my branch "additions" to my clone of Bethany's "Fail-log", no text editor opened to allow me to write a commit comment. I made [an annotation](https://hyp.is/vAsWgmUBEeen6QfLxnJi4A/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Exercises/) asking for help.
- when moving between branches in my clone of Bethany's "Fail-log", I cd'd into a branch titled "orgin/master". When I tried to commit changes, I got what I believe was an error message saying "HEAD detached from origin/master." EEP! I took a screenshot which I have uploaded to this repo as module1exersice4errormsg.PNG.
- I created a branch in my clone of Bethany's "Fail-log" called "master" which did not seem to work as the master branch. I believe now that origin/master was the actual master branch. Perhaps I couldn't modify it because it was a clone of Bethany's original.
- I finished the exercise by creating a new branch, adding a new file to that branch, and successfully creating a pull request for that branch.

### reflection/next steps
- This was much more involved than I expected!
- I will post on slack asking my classmates for help regarding recovering my lost command history.
- I will post on slack asking my classmates about the error message I recieved while trying to modify my clone of Bethany's repo.
