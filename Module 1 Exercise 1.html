<p>Bethany Pehora, Claire Maier, and Kayleigh Gagne created an excellent comment thread on <a href="https://hyp.is/jgWFmGLpEeeigtsMDwFx4g/www.themacroscope.org/?page_id=603">Bethany’s annotation</a> of “Why This All Matters Now: The Third Wave of Computational History” in <em>The Historian’s Macroscope</em>. In response to the temporary nature of ancient data (such as Sophocles’ plays), Bethany writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re constantly asking whether it is the right thing to document everything. Do we miss out on the show by making sure it is all preserved? Or do we ensure that people after have a chance to see it? Which is more important?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Claire gave taking pictures on vacation as a more modern version of this conundrum. Kayleigh responds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of me feels as though the culture of wanting to preserve/document experiences has arisen more prominently since the invent of the internet… That’s not to say that people from much earlier times didn’t try to do the same; rather, they likely faced greater challenges of preserving documents that were in physical form. I think they focused more on then living in the moment than society does today, due to the perceived necessity/social construction of leaving a mark via social media.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These comments struck me because they attempt to answer a simple yet daunting question: just how self-obsessed are we? And are we, in the present, more so than people were in the past? I think Kayleigh raises a great point that documentation is easier today than it ever has been. I disagree with her conclusion, though, that ease of documentation has made us MORE interested in “leaving a mark” - I think it’s just made that process more accessible and thus more part of everyday life.</p>
<p>I’ll admit, I’m not much of a photo-taker, and I don’t love it when people on my guided tours are more interested in taking photographs than they are in the information I’m giving them. I believe in moderation and minimalism, and there are only so many photos that will be meaningful to the photographer in the future. That being said, I think it’s wonderful that we have taken our biological instinct towards self-preservation and applied it to culture. I love that we think about the future, and about preserving the present. I think this impulse has been around for far longer than social media or even digital media. <a href="https://hyp.is/jgWFmGLpEeeigtsMDwFx4g/www.themacroscope.org/?page_id=603">As I mentioned in my reply</a>, diaries used to be a huge part of daily life, especially for women. Today, our social media pages are our “diaries” (which leads to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/21/social-media-tech-companies-user-privacy">a whole wack of privacy issues</a>, but that’s beyond the scope of my point here). They serve a similar purpose, though in a more public venue - and there is an interesting conversation to be had about how much selfies are taken to <a href="http://bigthink.com/endless-innovation/plato-know-thy-selfie">document our ever-changing present</a> and how many are taken to <a href="https://skift.com/2015/04/24/selfies-are-changing-the-fundamental-reasons-why-we-travel/">make a social statement</a>.<br>
A more practical problem than our inability to “live in the moment” struck me as I read these annotations. The ease with which we can document the present hasn’t kept pace with our understanding of digital conservation. I can take a selfie, but I don’t really know what happens to the 1s and 0s of it, or how to make sure those 1s and 0s stay in the same configuration long enough to be accessible in the future. If  impulse to document the present is not just a fleeting need for social capital - and I think that at least some of it is - we need to start <a href="https://ianmilligan.ca/2013/04/08/saving-history-the-eternal-responsibility-of-the-historian/">considering the conservation of digital data</a>.</p>
